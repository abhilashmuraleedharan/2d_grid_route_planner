An exercise project to understand and implement A* Search algorithm.

Using A* search algorithm, this program will find the optimum path
between any 2 user given points in a 2 Dimensional ASCII Grid.

# Notes
* This is a starter exercise project which acts as a precursor to the OpenStreetMap Project
* Exercise requires the program to be written in a single main file with no OOP datastructures
